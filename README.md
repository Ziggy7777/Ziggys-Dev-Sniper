# Ziggys-Dev-Sniper

üéØ Axiom Dev Sniper

‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER: This is my first ever coding project. I'm a degen trader who learned to code just to build this tool. Use at your own risk and DYOR!

What is this?
A Chrome extension that automatically executes buy orders on Axiom.trade when a token's dev wallet sells above a certain threshold. Perfect for catching better entries on meme coins when devs dump their bags.
üöÄ How it works

Connect your Phantom wallet to the extension
Set your parameters (sell threshold %, buy amount, slippage)
Click the red dev snipe button on any trading pair you're watching
The tool monitors the dev wallet and automatically buys when they sell X% of their holdings
Profit? (hopefully)

 Use it, break it, fix it, whatever. Just don't blame me when your trades go wrong.
Remember: This tool is for educational purposes and personal use. Trade responsibly and never risk more than you can afford to lose. NFA (Not Financial Advice).
